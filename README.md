 - I go by:
   - Crypto-Path - My developer name
   - Schiytu37 - My known name
   - Cyphe Mercury - My personal name (not real name... yet \*emoji-smirk\*)
 - Coding Languages I use/maybe somewhat know:
   - HTML/JS/CSS - I use this the most but still have a lot to learn in server-side js and css (I don't use any outside libraries)
   - C: - Hehe looks like smiley face, ah, I need to stop getting distracted.
     - C# - Ehem Unity cough cough...
     - C - Tried to learn this but got bullied by my computer because sdk something something large number wasn't available for graphics
     - C++ - same as C but eventually I got it to work and then gave up because I found rust.
   - Python - I use this when I'm bored and want to test/mess around. I mainly use pygame but that's about all.
   - Rust - fun only mess around in it for projects only using command prompt. I want to learn this language's basics first before I move onto things I'd actually want to use so I don't make the same mistake as I did learning other languages.
- Goals:
  - Making a program that'll understand emotion (I don't have emotion or at least they're so dulled I don't notice them)
  - Making an MMORPG (or just a program the can connect to a dedicated server)
  - Making friends (Building friendships is too compicated so I'll use rust and python to make an ai I can talk to get rid of my lonelyness \*emoji-face_ignorant\*)
  - Making a program that'll teach me how to sleep (I forgot how to sleep, only way I can is when I have been up for so long that my body just stop functioning and falls asleep on its own) (but it's way too fun getting drunk on sleep deprivity so I'm not sure if this should stay a goal)
  - Uhm yes that goal, oh what ever am I refferencing to-? doesn't matter, this is just a reminder so I don't forget, so... shh shh, don't question it. EXRBNLFTRADNTMYNTSSGRYTBCMFMALMVEJPNLVNANPPRTMNTBCMRCHEXTRMNATWRLD, Don't try to decode this it's not the sort of thing you can decode my any normal means or by any means in fact, or at least it shouldn't, so don't try, you'll only waste you're own time. GL.

# History
I'mma just make this my about my life page ig but heyyyyyyy I'm actually bored enough to do it, your fault for reading it.
 - # My Engine History:

  - Scratch
   - Although I still return to scratch to mess around this is where I start learning the basics of coding and how everything works. I learnt how to use variables, different metheds to change them, and how math and programming work together. I returned to this a few time to get a better understanding of things or to easily test out ideas before I waste days attempting to implement it into a program I'm making. I primarily used this when I was in middle school and reffined to a school chromebook and didn't have my own laptop at the time.

  - Game Maker Studio 2
   - I start looking for a game engine and had originally got Unity but my brain hurt trying to do anything so I gave up and started looking for a new engine and found this. I made some of my first (questionably) "games" as one *might* call them. I still didn't and probably still don't know how to make a game look decent in world design and other things. I started my main project Morania the 2D Open World MMORPG, but it wasn't looking like I envisioned it and it was missing the MMO element so I scrapped it and stopped using GMS2 for large game plans. When I want to test out semi-more complex ideas instead of scratch I use this.

  - Unity
   - After giving up with Game Maker Studio 2 I tried this again and this time wasn't going to give up until I figured it out (took me about nonstop 30hours...) With that knoledge I could finally create a c# file and add it to a object yes that's all I learnt after ~30hours... I was having some problems... With my brain perhaps. M larger projects cam from this where I really wanted to add as much as possible and was also finally having fun programming but never actually finished any project unfortunateyl. Attempted to make a 4k rhythm games (Loadable maps, saved scores(broken), playable, barebone graphics). Attempted to make a 2d gravity and planets sandbox game (got really far almost done but error started coming in like dhadsklsdakf, Inventory system, planets and if planets are close enough you can jump from one another, clicking rocks or trees or other resources will destroy them and drop the collectable version, auto generated planets (kinda broken as it just spawned a planet at a random possition around the player every so long)). Attempted a magic creation rpg (Inventory system messed me up and made me give up, Ability to create a custom spell that based on the elements used it uses a certain amount of mana only increasable with equipment or levels).
  
  
 - # My Rhythm Game History:

  - Piano Tiles
    - I used to play a lot of Piano Tiles (Specifically a knock off that just had a ton of user uploaded songs called "Piano Tails" which doesn't seem to exist anymore) before I had a laptop which probably boosted my starting skill and ability to learn rhythmic patterns which helped me later, I don't know when I started probably around 2015 when I got my first phone (IPhone 5s)

    - (I don't classify Piano Tiles as a 4K VSRG)

   - osu!
     - I started osu!Std/Mania when I first got a laptop (Jan 25, 2020) and found Quaver a few months later (Sep 13, 2020) but didn't really have a reason to play it (back then I played specifically for rank and quaver was to small, even though I sucked), Due to some... unfortunate events I lost my ability to play ranked in osu! ehehm I wonder why. I could beat most 3* maps and only a few 4* maps that I practiced a lot (Final rank in o!m: ~80000-70000, PP: 3.5k, Top Play: Dark Flight Dream [4K] MX 96.84% 167pp). osu!Std I could beat most 5* map some 6* maps and I have beaten a 7* map, I have no saved records of the game anymore (new laptop + factory reset on old one bc it was messed up), I could FC most 4* maps and have FC'ed(Steam censors FC+ed ahahaha) a few 5* maps (Final Rank: somewhere around 220k, PP: 2.5k, Top Play: Mizouto to Curtain [Extra] 96.69% 146pp)

   - Quaver!
     - I moved completely to Quaver (Some time around March 2021 I think) and from there learned patterns and improved my max bpm/nps limit to handle Handstreams and Jack Chords (as of typing this I can do 18nps Handstreams at 200bpm, beat 25-30 diff rating with ease but struggle with 30-35dr, my Top play is 176 - ikazuchi [Ute!] 98.88% 31.04pr) when returning to osu! offline I got 300pp plays and could easily beat 5* maps.
